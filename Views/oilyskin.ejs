        <h2>1. Wash your face</h2>
        <div class="xyz">
            <div class="pqr">
        <p>It seems obvious, but many people with oily skin don’t wash their face daily. If your skin’s oily, you should wash your face twice a day — but don’t overdo it. 
            Avoid harsh soaps or detergents. Use a gentle soap such as glycerin soap instead.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Blotting papers</h3>
        <p>These thin, small papers won’t prevent your sebaceous glands from going into overdrive, but they’ll allow you to blot excess oil from your face to help minimize shiny, greasy skin. 
            Blotting papers are inexpensive and available over the counter. Use as needed throughout the day.</p>

            </div></div>
        <h4>3. Honey</h4>
        <p>To use honey to treat acne and oily skin, spread a thin layer, preferably raw, onto your face; 
            let it dry for about 10 minutes, and rinse thoroughly with warm water.</p>
    <h5>4. Cosmetic clay</h5>
    <p>Cosmetic clays, also called healing clays, are used to help absorb skin oil and treat many skin conditions.
         French green clay is a popular treatment for oily skin and acne since it’s highly absorbent. French green clay comes in powder form.</p>
       <h6>5. Oatmeal</h6>
       <p>Oatmeal helps calm inflamed skin and absorb excess oil. It also helps exfoliate dead skin. When used in facial masks, oatmeal is usually ground. 
        It can be combined with yogurt, honey, or mashed fruit such as bananas, apples, or papaya</p>
